# Installation Notes

1. Make sure your machine has the latest Microsoft Windows Updates. (Installation may take a while if machine is not up to date.)
2. Run via Powershell (Run as Administrator).
3. Execute "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -f rf-toolkit.ps1"

⚠️ Windows Powershell restart is required after the Robot Framework installation to successfully run python and robot.
Re-open the powershell as Administrator again and re-run the rf-toolkit.ps1 ⚠️

If Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers are installed on your local machine, RF-Toolkit.Robottests should pass.
